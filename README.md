# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to analyze the ride-sharing data for different type of cities - urban, rural and suburban. The analysis would involve calculating metrics such as avg. fares per city, avg rides per city, avg drivers per city type, total fare by city type.

These metrics will help understand not just the current snapshot situation but also provide a meanigful trend towards identifying access and affordability issues for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

### PyBer Summary
- Suburban areas have 6 times number of drivers than rural areas, and urban areas have nearly 6 times than suburban.
- A similar pattern is observed in the number of rides - Urban areas have nealry 3 times rides as compared to Suburban and 13 times than rural.
- Due to the large number of rides in Urban areas, avg. fare per ride is greatest in rural areas and smallest in urban centers.
- Since urban centers have nearly 31 times more drivers than rural areas, there is a marked difference in avg. fare acros different areas. Rural centers have an average fare of $55 per driver, which is nearly 4 times that of urban centers.

### Total Fare by City Type Summary
- The peak for total fare for every city type is just before March.
- Both urban and rural centers show a dip in total fares from Mid-April onwards. However suburban aread show a marked increased trend in total fares. This could be due to the increased ride usage as summer starts and there is little local transport as compared to urban centers.
- While both urban and suburban centers show a gradual increase in total fare over the time period selected, rural centers show a flat line over the same period.

## Summary

 - While urban centers need mmore drivers and rides due to bigger population, it looks like that the urban centers have way too many drivers right now. Both suburban and rural centers accounted for more rides than they had drivers, urban centers show far more drivers than rides. This is hurting the drivers and company. Due to too many drivers, the avg fare for urban centers is too less. Some drivers could be zoned to serve suburban and nearby rural centers.
 
 - Rural centers have the highest rides to drivers ratio among all areas - 1.6. This indicates that many customers do need rides but cannot take them because there aren't enough drivers. More drivers should be added to rural areas to address this discrepancy.
 
 - It also looks like that the drivers in rural areas are charging too much since there are just not enough of them. This could also be causing a number of riding requests being cancelled or not being looked into as an option by customers in rural areas. We should look into this if there is some organized price fixing going on.
